abstract classes are classes that have at least one pure virtual function. 
A pure virtual function is declared with "= 0"



1. **Virtual Function**:
   - A virtual function is a member function of a class that can be overridden in derived classes.
   - It has a default implementation in the base class, but derived classes can provide their own implementations.
   - The base class can also choose to provide a default implementation for a virtual function.

2. **Pure Virtual Function**:
   - A pure virtual function is a virtual function that has no implementation in the base class.
   - It is declared with "= 0" at the end of its declaration, indicating that it must be overridden by derived classes.
   - Classes containing pure virtual functions cannot be instantiated directly; they become abstract classes, serving as interfaces or blueprints for derived classes.
   - Derived classes must provide an implementation for all pure virtual functions to become concrete classes.



concrete class ??

A concrete class in C++ is a class that can be instantiated, meaning you can create objects of that class type. 

it means it the opositr of an abstruct - wish meanins concret calss is a calss that does not contain any pure virtual function.





the constructor of the base class is called automatically by the constructor of the derived class.

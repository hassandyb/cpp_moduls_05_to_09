In C++, `std::istringstream`, `std::ostringstream`, and `std::stringstream` are three different classes provided by the Standard Library for string stream operations:

1. `std::istringstream`: This class is used for input operations on strings. You would typically use it when you want to read data from a string as if it were a stream. You can extract data from it using the extraction operator (`>>`).

2. `std::ostringstream`: This class is used for output operations on strings. You would typically use it when you want to construct a string by writing data to a stream. You can insert data into it using the insertion operator (`<<`).

3. `std::stringstream`: This class combines both input and output functionalities. It allows you to both read from and write to strings as if they were streams. You can use extraction (`>>`) for input operations and insertion (`<<`) for output operations.

Here's a summary:

- Use `std::istringstream` (`iss`) when you want to read data from a string.
- Use `std::ostringstream` (`oss`) when you want to write data to a string.
- Use `std::stringstream` (`ss`) when you want to both read from and write to a string.

You choose the appropriate object based on whether you need input, output, or both operations on the string.

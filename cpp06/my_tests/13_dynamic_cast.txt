`dynamic_cast` is a casting operator in C++ that is primarily used for performing safe downcasting in polymorphic class hierarchies. It's specifically designed to work with polymorphic types, meaning types with at least one virtual function.

Here's a brief overview of `dynamic_cast` and its usefulness:

### Purpose of `dynamic_cast`:

1. **Downcasting**: It's often necessary to convert pointers or references of a base class to pointers or references of a derived class. `dynamic_cast` allows you to perform this downcasting safely during runtime.

2. **Type Checking**: Unlike `static_cast`, which performs implicit type conversions and doesn't perform runtime type checking, `dynamic_cast` verifies whether the downcast is valid at runtime, making it safer to use.

### Key Features:

- **Runtime Type Identification (RTTI)**: `dynamic_cast` utilizes RTTI to determine whether the object being pointed to by the base class pointer is actually of the derived class type.

- **Handling of Pointers**: When casting pointers using `dynamic_cast`, if the cast fails (i.e., the object being pointed to is not of the desired derived type), the result is a null pointer.

- **Handling of References**: When casting references using `dynamic_cast`, if the cast fails, it throws a `std::bad_cast` exception. This allows you to handle failed casts using exception handling mechanisms.

### Example Usage:

```cpp
Base* basePtr = new Derived(); // Assuming Derived class inherits from Base

// Attempt to downcast from Base pointer to Derived pointer using dynamic_cast
Derived* derivedPtr = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(basePtr);

if (derivedPtr) {
    // If downcast successful, use derivedPtr
} else {
    // If downcast failed, handle the failure
}
```

### Usefulness:

- **Safe Downcasting**: `dynamic_cast` provides a mechanism for safely downcasting pointers and references in polymorphic class hierarchies, reducing the risk of accessing invalid memory or invoking undefined behavior.

- **Run-Time Flexibility**: Since `dynamic_cast` performs checks at runtime, it allows for dynamic decisions based on the actual type of the object being referenced or pointed to, enabling more flexible and robust code.

In the exercise you provided, `dynamic_cast` is used to identify the actual derived type of an object pointed to by a base class pointer or reference, ensuring safe and correct behavior when working with polymorphic types.

In C++, a literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. When we write a value directly in our code, such as `42` or `3.14`, we are using literals.

Here are some common types of literals in C++:

1. **Integer Literals**: These are whole numbers without any fractional or decimal part. For example: `42`, `-10`, `0`, etc.

2. **Floating-point Literals**: These are numbers with a fractional part. They can be represented in decimal or scientific notation. For example: `3.14`, `-0.5`, `6.02e23` (scientific notation), etc.

3. **Character Literals**: These are single characters enclosed in single quotes. For example: `'A'`, `'5'`, `'\n'`, etc.

4. **String Literals**: These are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes. For example: `"Hello"`, `"42"`, `"C++"`, etc.

5. **Boolean Literals**: These represent the Boolean values `true` and `false`.

6. **Null Pointer Literal**: This is represented by the keyword `nullptr` and represents a null pointer.

So, when your exercise mentions "C++ literals," it's referring to these various ways of representing values directly in your C++ code. The goal of your `ScalarConverter` class will be to take a string representation of one of these literals (e.g., `"42"`, `"3.14"`, `"A"`) and convert it to its corresponding values in `char`, `int`, `float`, and `double` types.

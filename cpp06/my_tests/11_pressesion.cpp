`std::fixed` and `std::setprecision` are manipulators provided by the C++ Standard Library's `<iomanip>` header for formatting floating-point numbers when outputting them with `std::cout`.

- **`std::fixed`**: This manipulator sets the floating-point output format to fixed-point notation. In fixed-point notation, the number of digits after the decimal point remains constant, regardless of the magnitude of the number. This means that the output will always have the specified number of digits after the decimal point.

- **`std::setprecision`**: This manipulator sets the precision (i.e., the number of digits after the decimal point) for floating-point output. It specifies the number of significant digits to be printed.

Here's how you typically use them:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

int main() {
    double nbr = 123.45678;

    // Set precision to 3 decimal places and use fixed-point notation
    std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(3) << nbr << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

- In this example, `std::fixed` ensures that the number is printed in fixed-point notation.
- `std::setprecision(3)` sets the precision to 3 decimal places, meaning that the output will display 3 digits after the decimal point.
- When used together, they ensure that the output of the floating-point number `nbr` is formatted to have exactly 3 digits after the decimal point, regardless of its magnitude.

Using `std::fixed` and `std::setprecision` together ensures consistent and controlled formatting of floating-point numbers, which can be particularly useful when dealing with financial data, scientific calculations, or any situation where you need to control the precision of your output.

"Pseudo literals" in the context of your exercise refer to special representations for infinity and NaN (Not a Number). These are values that are not represented directly as numbers in source code but are instead represented by specific symbols or keywords. 

Here's what they mean:

1. **Infinity (`inf`, `-inf`)**: These represent positive infinity and negative infinity, respectively. They are used to denote values that exceed the maximum or minimum representable value for a floating-point type.

2. **NaN (`nan`)**: This represents a "Not a Number" value, which indicates undefined or unrepresentable results of floating-point arithmetic operations, such as taking the square root of a negative number or dividing zero by zero.

In C++, these pseudo literals are typically represented by special symbols or keywords. For example:

- `inf`: Positive infinity
- `-inf`: Negative infinity
- `nan`: Not a Number

Your `ScalarConverter` class needs to handle these pseudo literals as well, converting them to appropriate representations in `float` and `double` types, and possibly indicating that conversion to other types like `int` or `char` is not possible or meaningful.
